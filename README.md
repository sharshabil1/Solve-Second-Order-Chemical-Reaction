# Bisection Method to Solve for Time in a Second-Order Chemical Reaction
#### In this project, we aim to determine the time at which the concentration of a reactant in a second-order chemical reaction reaches a predefined target value. Specifically, given the initial concentration of the reactant, the reaction rate constant, and the desired concentration, we seek to find the value of time (t) that satisfies the integrated rate law for a second-order reaction:
##    1 / [A] = 1 / [A₀] + kt
### Rearranging this equation gives us a nonlinear function of time:
##    f(t) = (1 / [A₀]) + kt - (1 / [A_d])
#### Solving f(t) = 0 using analytical methods may not always be practical. Therefore, we will apply the bisection method, a robust numerical technique, to approximate the root of this function, thus determining the required time with a high degree of accuracy.
